Prepare for a long line around lunch or dinner hours. \n\nThey ask you how you want you meat, lean or something maybe, I can't remember. Just say you don't want it too fatty. \n\nGet a half sour pickle and a hot pepper. Hand cut french fries too.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It's been around since the 30's and they still serve the same thing they started with: a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard. \n\nStaff was very helpful and friendly.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant. Call for a reservation. \n\nWe had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go. \n\nA bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They are known for smoked meat which most deli's have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside. \n\nThe smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. \n\nThe food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. \n\nGetting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

So light and buttery and oh my how chocolaty.\n\nIf you're looking for a light breakfast then head out here.

Got a groupon and rented the bike for 11 of us for an afternoon tour. Each bar was more fun than the last. Downtown Las Vegas has changed so much and for the better. We had a wide age range in this group from early 20's to mid 50's and everyone had so much fun! Our driver Tony was knowledgable , friendly and just plain fun! Would recommend this to anyone looking to do something different away from the strip. You won't be disappointed!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

When I don't have time to go to Chinatown, this is the next best thing as it is down the street from me.\n\nSo far the only items I have tried are the phos (beef, chicken & vegetarian) - and they have not disappointed me! Especially the chicken pho.\n\nNext time I go back, I'm going to try the banh cuon (steamed rice noodle) and the vermicelli!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":2}
