Sweet potato wedges are well paired with the wasabi mayo. \n\nRolls are very good. They have a different pink dragon roll that has scallops on the top. Green dragon rolls are definitely a must try. The avocado is very thinly sliced sprinkled with something yummy on top.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Although, we made reservations and checked in a few minutes early, we still had to wait a good 45 minutes before sitting down at our table. When we made the reservations, we were informed we would have to leave a certain time - which we didn't think they would enforce, considering we did not get our table in time. However, they did, and we were not impressed.\n\nThe space in the restaurant is also very tight, my boyfriend got hit in the head a few times while sitting at the table.\n\nI had ordered a seafood pasta dish, which was kind of bland (not much flavour). My boyfriend had ordered one of the specials of the night - filet mignon, which also was not up to par.\n\nOverall, I've had better pasta. I'm not sure if it was just the two dishes I had that wasn't up to par, as my other friends did enjoy theirs.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Noodles are delicious and you definitely need to make sure you save room in your stomach for this when you come to pacific mall!\n\nAfter trying a few things on the menu - the true favourite is still the dan dan noodles. There is something about the spicy peanut sauce soup base that makes it so flavourful. Plus when you add their homemade chili oil - it makes it so good.\n\nBecause of Sun's dan dan noodles - my bf and I will always order the dan fan noodle whenever we see it on the menu but so far, no one has the same flavour as Sun's. Sun's    is the best we have had!!!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Their specialty are mousse drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it was. So when we asked the staff, they said it was some sort of cheese. \n\nFor a Sunday afternoon, they were also out of grass jelly and pudding, which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works).\n\nThe service is really bad, they don't understand English so when you asked them about the menu items, they can't really explain what they are.\n\nWe had ordered the following:\n- slush mango (came with tapioca and mousse)\n- peach ice tea\n- roasted oolong milk tea\n- supernova kumquat lemonade\n\nAnd when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks), and the kumquat lemonade, they said it had a layer of blue mousse - so we were like ok we will try it then. But what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonade. When we asked them again, they said it was just a size difference, that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large. \n\nThe mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea wasn't bad. But the other two was not that great. The tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everything. There was no peach taste in the peach ice tea. The kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all.\n\nI guess if you need a non-busy place to use WIFI and work, then this is the place, no one wants to come here.\n\nAlso - their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks, which were intriguing to us, but you are not allowed to take the lightbulb home...\n\nWe will definitely not be returning...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

At first, I wasn't impress that it was a 45 mins wait, however my BF really wanted to try this piece, so we decided to wait.\n\nIt was definitely different and worth the wait. \n\nWe started off with the House Cured Meat - it was good - but definitely too much for just 2 people to share (and no need to order the extra bread if it's only two people).\n\nNext came the roasted bone marrow - which is amazing and definitely worth ordering. Had we not ordered so many other dishes, we would have ordered a second round of this. Who knew bone marrow could be this tasty!!\n\nThen came the Spicy Horse Tartare, which we thought was intriguing, as we have never heard, so we had ordered it. When it showed up, it was like a salad. Wasn't bad, worth trying but probably only a one-time thing for us.\n\nTongue on Brioche is definitely another worth ordering. it is a sandwich that tasted like a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. SO GOOD that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tender. If it wasn't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up, we would have devoured it.\n\nFor dessert, we had ordered the Foie and Nutella, as we thought this was very interesting. It was good, but after 4 dishes already, this was just a little too rich. It came with banana bread that was really good.\n\nOverall, definitely worth the try! Just make sure you bring cash =)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}
