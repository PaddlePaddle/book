## Running the Book

This book you are reading is interactive -- each chapter can run as a Jupyter Notebook.

We packed this book, Jupyter, PaddlePaddle, and all dependencies into a Docker image. So you don't need to install anything except Docker. If you are using Windows, please follow [this installation guide](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows).  If you are running Mac, please follow [this](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac). For various Linux distros, please refer to https://www.docker.com.  If you are using Windows or Mac, you might want to give Docker [more memory and CPUs/cores](http://stackoverflow.com/a/39720010/724872).

Just type

```bash
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 paddlepaddle/book

```

This command will download the pre-built Docker image from DockerHub.com and run it in a container.  Please direct your Web browser to http://localhost:8888 to read the book.

If you are living in somewhere slow to access DockerHub.com, you might try our mirror server docker.paddlepaddlehub.com:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 docker.paddlepaddlehub.com/book

```

### Training with GPU

By default we are using CPU for training, if you want to train with GPU, the steps are a little different.

To make sure GPU can be successfully used from inside container, please install [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker). Then run:

```bash
nvidia-docker run -d -p 8888:8888 paddlepaddle/book:latest-gpu

```

Or you can use the image registry mirror in China:

```bash
nvidia-docker run -d -p 8888:8888 docker.paddlepaddlehub.com/book:latest-gpu

```

Change the code in the chapter that you are reading from
```python
use_cuda = False
```

to:
```python
use_cuda = True
```


## Contribute

Your contribution is welcome!  Please feel free to file Pull Requests to add your chapter as a directory under `/pending`. Once it is going stable, the community would like to move it to `/`.

To write, run, and debug your chapters, you will need Python 2.x, Go >1.5. You can build the Docker image using [this script](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/blob/develop/.tools/convert-markdown-into-ipynb-and-test.sh).
